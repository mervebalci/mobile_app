# Here RootWidget is the parent, and then comes LoginScreen.
# Under LoginScreen, there are children such as GridLayout (line8), then another GridLayout (line10), then TextInput and so on.
<LoginScreen>:
    GridLayout:
        cols: 1
        GridLayout:
            cols: 1
            Label:
                text: "User Login"
            TextInput:
                id: username
                hint_text: "Username"
            TextInput:

                # So when you are in the kivy file, root will point to the associated class, which is <LoginScreen>
                # In python file, self is pointing to LoginScreen class. 
                # And <loginScreen> in kivy file will communicate to class LoginScreen in python file and they receive data.
                # That means self knows about the ids and all the widgets that the logging screen contains.
            Label:
                id: wrong_login
                text: ""

            Button:
                text: "Sign Up"

<SignUpScreen>:
    GridLayout:

            # When the user press the submit button, the username and the password will be send to database where usernames and passwords are saved.
            # And this database is a json file which will be writable and readable.
            # root refers to SignUpScreen (in kivy file), add_user is the method in SignUpScreen Class (in python file)
            # ids is a property of the SignUpScreen Object which comes from Screen (in python file)
            # Screen is inherited to SignUpScreen and SignUpScreen has this id which gives a sort of dictionary with all the ids contained in the SignUpScreen.
            # So in this case, it gives access to username, to password.
            # root.ids.password gives text to the TextInput Object which has an id, a password
            # With .text, the value of the object (username or password object) becomes accessible.
