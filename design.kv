            # root refers to SignUpScreen (in kivy file), add_user is the method in SignUpScreen Class (in python file)
            # ids is a property of the SignUpScreen Object which comes from Screen (in python file)
            # Screen is inherited to SignUpScreen and SignUpScreen has this id which gives a sort of dictionary with all the ids contained in the SignUpScreen.

                # Without assigning a size, each widget shares the GridLayout equally.
                # Now, I should give more space to the Label inside the GridLayout, because some quotes are longer and overlaying on top of button.

                # First item is width which is [0]. Second item is height which is [1].
                # With this, Label is dynamic which means it's changing its size depending on the size of the text.
                # However, it's not ideal. According to the size of the quote, screen is changing.
                # To solve this, ScrollView widget should be added as parent of Label.
